    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LOGIC:\n",
    "\n",
    "We create two lists, fifo_queue to put in the packets and priority_queue to put in the tuple\n",
    "of priority number and the packet details.\n",
    "\n",
    "simulate packet data generation that is 'flowing' in the network by creating a list\n",
    "in which will contain dictionaries that represent the network packet.\n",
    "id, data (short description), and mainly, the threat level: low, medium or high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a for loop, iterate through the packets in the packets list, and simply\n",

    "              {\"id\": 4, \"data\": \"Normal Traffic\", \"threat\": \"Medium\"}]\n",
    "              \n",
    "Now we need to deal with the priority queue. First we have to set priority values to \n",
    "differentiate which threat level is what value to be mapped to. Lower the value, higher the priority.\n",

    "[1] = the actual packet data (the dictionary). We add/append the tuples to the priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "priority_queue.append((priority_mapping[packet[\"threat\"]], packet))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for e.g., in the first iteration, it would look like:\n",
    "priority_queue = [(3, {\"id\": 1, \"data\": \"Normal Data\", \"threat\": \"Low\"})]\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have the priority queue filled, but when we process it later in the code,\n",
    "we want to process the queue in the correct order i.e., the highest priority packet should be processed first.\n",
    "So, we sort the priority queue list which contains the tuples into ascending order,\n",
    "specifically the priority values.\n",
    "\n",
    "when we use priority_queue.sort(),\n",
    "python attempts to compare the dictionaries within the tuples during the sort() operation, which isn't allowed. To fix this, \n",
    "we need to ensure the sort operation compares only the priority values (the first element of the tuples).\n",
    "So we use a quick way to define a function - lambda and take a parameter (x) which represents an item from the\n",
    "priority queue and we use the expression to return just the first element x[0] of the tuple i.e., the priority value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we sort these values:\n",
    "priority_queue.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n",

    "                  \n",
    "now we have both our queues ready for processing. But one more thing is left,\n",
    "we have to define what packet is malicious, so that, during processing, we can decide\n",
    "which packet to remove. so we simply define a list of packet IDs that are considered malicious. \n",
    "Here, packet with ID 3 is flagged as malicious:\n",
    "malicious_ids = [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "now we process fifo_queue:\n",
    "so in a while loop, we pop the first packet in the list/queue (FIFO principle) and prints (returns) it on our\n",
