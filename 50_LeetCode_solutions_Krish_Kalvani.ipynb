    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array nums and two integers indexDiff and valueDiff.\n",
    "Find a pair of indices (i, j) such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "i != j,\n",
    "abs(i - j) <= indexDiff.\n",
    "abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff, and\n",
    "Return true if such pair exists or false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LOGIC:\n",
    "\n",
    "i used a brute-force approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "we can iterate over the array nums and for each number nums[i], we check the \n",
    "subsequent numbers nums[j] within the range defined by indexDiff (i.e., i < j <= i + indexDiff).\n",
    "\n",
    "for each pair (i, j), we check:\n",
    "\n",
    "if abs(i - j) <= indexDiff\n",
    "if abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff\n",
    "if we find such a pair, we return True. If no such pair exists after checking all valid pairs, we return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "ill make a for loop to iterate through the numbers 'n'. in the nested for loop,\n",
    "for the condition: abs(i - j) < = indexDiff\n",
    "i can apply the condition in the nested for loop statement i.e.,\n",
    "for j in range(i + 1, min(i + indexDiff + 1, n)):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that j satisfies the condition abs(i - j) <= indexDiff because:\n",
    "\n",
    "i is the starting index.\n",
    "j starts from i + 1 and goes up to i + indexDiff.\n",
    "This guarantees that abs(i - j) will be at most indexDiff because the loop ensures that j is always within the window defined by i + indexDiff.\n",
    "So, the loop already ensures that we do not check pairs of indices i and j where the absolute difference of their indices is greater than indexDiff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, since the inner loop starts at i + 1, meaning j will always be greater than i,\n",
    "this automatically ensures that i != j.\n",
    "\n",
    "the next condition i.e., abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= valueDiff\n",
    "will be executed inside the nested for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one way of doing it, but we can also separatley code the conditions in a simple nested for loop.\n",
    "for example, here is a rough code of how i initially thought of doing this:\n",
